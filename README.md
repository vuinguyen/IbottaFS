# IbottaFS

The IbottaFS app was written in Swift 2.3 as part of my job application for the iOS developer position at Ibotta. It is called IbottaFS for Ibotta Fun Size, as it is my re-engineering of the Ibotta mobile app (fun-sized) as a checklist app, which is different from how the actual Ibotta app works today.
